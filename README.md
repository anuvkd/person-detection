# Person Detection in Video using Faster R-CNN and GStreamer

This Python script uses TensorFlow, OpenCV, and GStreamer to detect persons in a video file using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model. Detected persons are annotated with bounding boxes and saved as individual frames.

## Getting Started

### Python Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

### GStreamer

Ensure GStreamer is installed on your system. Installation methods vary by platform (Linux, macOS).

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuvkd/person-detection
cd repository-directory
```

### Download the pre trained model
